# Phylogenetic methods:

---

Two trees were inferred for each individual:
* Tree with synthetic outgroup (`\*.outgroup.iqtree\*`)
* Tree without synthetic outgroup

Metadata associated with each tree is reported in `\*.iqtree`
Maximum-likelihood topology with node support values represented as [SH-aLRT]/[UFbootstrap Support %] in `\*.treefile`

Trees are presented in as `NEWICK` files and can be readily visualized using software like [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and/or [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/)
